# React Security Rules
# Applies to: **/*.{jsx,tsx}

When working with React components:

- Never use dangerouslySetInnerHTML without proper sanitization
- Use React's built-in XSS protections
- Sanitize props before rendering user-generated content
- Avoid using refs to directly manipulate the DOM
- Use secure state management practices
- Implement proper authentication checks for protected routes
- Never store sensitive information in localStorage or sessionStorage
