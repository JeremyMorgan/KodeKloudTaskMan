# Security Best Practices
# Applies to: **/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,py,rb}

When generating or modifying code, follow these security guidelines:

- Never use eval() or similar functions that execute dynamic code
- Sanitize all user inputs before processing
- Use parameterized queries for database operations to prevent SQL injection
- Implement proper input validation for all user-provided data
- Apply the principle of least privilege for all operations
- Use secure, up-to-date encryption methods (AES-256, RSA-2048 or higher)
- Avoid storing sensitive information in client-side code
- Implement proper error handling that doesn't expose system details
- Use HTTPS for all external communications
- Follow OWASP Top 10 guidelines to prevent common vulnerabilities

For authentication:
- Use secure password hashing with bcrypt or Argon2
- Implement proper session management with secure cookies
- Use CSRF tokens for form submissions
- Set appropriate security headers in all responses

For API endpoints:
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Use proper authentication and authorization checks
- Validate all incoming data against a schema
